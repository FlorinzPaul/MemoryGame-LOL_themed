        <p>Welcome to the League of Legends: Memory Game, a fun and interactive way to test your memory and knowledge of your favorite champions! This game combines strategy and memory skills in an exciting challenge that’s perfect for fans of the iconic MOBA game 'League of Legends'.</p>

            <h3>How to Play</h3>
            <p>The game begins with a grid of face-down cards, each hiding an image of a League of Legends champion.
                Your goal is to match all the pairs of champion cards.
                Click on a card to reveal its image, then try to find its matching pair.
                If the cards match, they stay flipped. If not, they’ll flip back, and you’ll have to remember their positions.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Game Modes</h3>
            <p>In PROGRESSIVE MODE, your goal is to match all the cards and each time you clear a level, next sets of cards increases.</p>
            <p>While in TIME-TRIAL MODE, your goal is to clear all the cards in the shortest time possible. Each difficulty has a different amount of card sets.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Why Play?</h3>
            <p>This memory game isn’t just about flipping cards—it’s a tribute to the League of Legends universe. Challenge your cognitive skills, improve memory, and have fun while reconnecting with your favorite champions.
                <br>
                Start flipping and prove your memory is as sharp as your skills on Summoner's Rift!</p>
